# Known Issues

## 1. Replication Not Working (CRITICAL)

**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**

**Problem**: 
- Nodes were publishing `EventDataOperation` events but not receiving replicated events
- Correlation IDs were not preserved across node boundaries
- Event subscription was missing from main application

**Root Cause**:
- Event bus had subscription capability but main.go wasn't subscribing to events
- Nodes could publish events but had no listeners for incoming events
- Missing event handler for processing replicated operations

**Solution Applied**:
- ✅ Added event subscription in `main.go` after coordinator start
- ✅ Created `handleReplicationEvent` function to process incoming replication events
- ✅ Fixed function signature to use `*storage.BasicStore` instead of `storage.Store`
- ✅ Implemented proper correlation ID propagation in event structure
- ✅ Added context-aware logging for all replication operations

**Verification**:
- ✅ Cross-node replication working: Node-1 receives events from Node-2 and Node-3
- ✅ Correlation IDs preserved: Same correlation ID appears in original request and replicated event
- ✅ Both SET and DELETE operations replicated successfully
- ✅ Event publishing logs appearing: `"SET event published for replication"`
- ✅ Cuckoo filter integration working with correlation ID context
- ✅ Structured logging shows complete event flow: publish → gossip → receive → apply

**Evidence from Logs**:
```
"Received replication event","correlation_id":"9eaf6608-1f28-4f9b-a03e-16dff296d49b","source_node":"node-2","target_node":"node-1"
"Successfully applied replicated SET","correlation_id":"6834e4ac-ec90-426f-aaf1-0930e8965c6d"
"SET event published for replication","correlation_id":"9eaf6608-1f28-4f9b-a03e-16dff296d49b"
```

## 2. Startup Logs in Different Files and Getting Deleted

**Status**: ✅ **FIXED**

**Problem**: 
- Startup logs appeared to be written to different files
- Some startup logs got deleted or overwritten
- Inconsistent logging during node initialization

**Root Cause**:
- Build/start scripts were redirecting stdout/stderr to temporary files: `node1_startup.log`, `node2_startup.log`, etc.
- These temporary files captured early startup messages and were deleted when processes stopped
- This separated early console output from the structured JSON logs

**Solution Applied**:
- ✅ Removed stdout/stderr redirection from `scripts/build-and-run.sh` and `scripts/start-cluster.sh`
- ✅ Converted early `log.Fatalf()` calls to `fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, ...)` + `os.Exit(1)` for clarity
- ✅ Updated script messaging to point to main log files: `logs/node-1.log`, `logs/node-2.log`, `logs/node-3.log`
- ✅ All startup messages now go to proper structured logging system

**Verification**:
- No temporary `node*_startup.log` files are created
- All startup messages appear in main log files: `logs/node-*.log`
- Early startup messages and structured logs are properly consolidated
- Log files persist across server restarts

## Priority

✅ **ALL CRITICAL ISSUES RESOLVED**
1. ✅ **RESOLVED**: ~~Fix replication~~ - Cross-node replication working with correlation ID preservation
2. ✅ **RESOLVED**: ~~Fix startup logging~~ - All startup logs properly consolidated in main log files

## Test Plan

### ✅ For Replication (COMPLETED):
1. ✅ Added event subscription to main application
2. ✅ Implemented replication event handler  
3. ✅ Verified cross-node event delivery via gossip
4. ✅ Confirmed correlation ID propagation end-to-end
5. ✅ Tested both SET and DELETE replication operations
6. ✅ Validated Cuckoo filter integration with context logging

### ✅ For Logging (COMPLETED):
1. ✅ Removed temporary startup log file creation
2. ✅ Consolidated all logs into main node log files
3. ✅ Verified startup messages are preserved
4. ✅ Confirmed no temporary files are created or deleted
