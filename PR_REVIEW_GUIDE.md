## 📋 **Systematic Review Process**

### Step 1: High-Level Architecture Review

```bash
# Check the main architectural changes
git diff origin/main internal/cluster/interfaces.go
```

**Questions to ask:**
- ✅ Are the interfaces clean and well-defined?
- ✅ Does it follow Redis cluster patterns?
- ✅ Are dependencies properly abstracted?

### Step 2: Core Implementation Review

```bash
# Review the hash ring implementation
git diff origin/main internal/cluster/hashring.go

# Review the distributed coordinator
git diff origin/main internal/cluster/distributed_coordinator.go
```

**Key things to check:**
- ✅ Hash slot calculation (should be 16,384 slots like Redis)
- ✅ Consistent hashing implementation
- ✅ Node addition/removal handling
- ✅ Replication factor handling

### Step 3: RESP Protocol Changes

```bash
# Check RESP protocol enhancements
git diff origin/main internal/network/resp/protocol.go
git diff origin/main internal/network/resp/server.go
```

**Critical checks:**
- ✅ MOVED response format: `-MOVED {slot} {host}:{port}\\r\\n`
- ✅ ASK response format (if implemented)
- ✅ Proper error handling for redirects
- ✅ Backward compatibility with existing RESP commands

### Step 4: Test Coverage Review

```bash
# Check test files
git diff origin/main internal/cluster/slots_test.go
git diff origin/main internal/network/resp/moved_test.go
```

**Test quality checks:**
- ✅ Edge cases covered (empty slots, node failures)
- ✅ Hash collision handling
- ✅ MOVED response parsing
- ✅ Integration test scenarios

## 🧪 **Manual Testing Guide**

### Test 1: Basic Cluster Formation
```bash
# Start the cluster
docker-compose -f docker-compose.scalable.yml up -d

# Check cluster status
curl http://localhost:9080/cluster/status

# Expected: All nodes should show as healthy and connected
```

### Test 2: Key Distribution Testing
```bash
# Connect to any node
redis-cli -c -h localhost -p 8080

# Test key distribution
127.0.0.1:8080> SET key1 "value1"
# Should either succeed or return: -MOVED 1234 192.168.1.2:8080

127.0.0.1:8080> SET key2 "value2" 
127.0.0.1:8080> SET key3 "value3"

# Test retrieval
127.0.0.1:8080> GET key1
# Should work or redirect properly
```

### Test 3: MOVED Response Format
```bash
# Test with raw RESP protocol
telnet localhost 8080

# Send: *3\\r\\n$3\\r\\nSET\\r\\n$4\\r\\ntest\\r\\n$5\\r\\nvalue\\r\\n
# Expected response format:
# - Success: +OK\\r\\n
# - Redirect: -MOVED 1234 192.168.1.2:8080\\r\\n
```

### Test 4: Client Compatibility
```bash
# Test with various Redis clients
python3 -c "
import redis
r = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=8080)
try:
    r.set('test_key', 'test_value')
    print('SUCCESS: Key set')
    print(f'Value: {r.get(\"test_key\")}')
except redis.ResponseError as e:
    print(f'MOVED response: {e}')
"
```

## 🔧 **Code Quality Checks**

### Performance Concerns
```bash
# Check for potential bottlenecks
grep -r "range.*nodes" internal/cluster/
grep -r "lock" internal/cluster/
```

**Look for:**
- ✅ Efficient hash calculations
- ✅ Minimal locking in hot paths
- ✅ O(1) slot lookups
- ✅ Proper connection pooling

### Error Handling
```bash
# Check error scenarios
grep -r "error" internal/cluster/
grep -r "Error" internal/network/resp/
```

**Verify:**
- ✅ Network failures handled gracefully
- ✅ Node unavailability doesn't crash system
- ✅ Invalid slot numbers handled
- ✅ Malformed MOVED responses caught

### Memory Management
```bash
# Check for potential memory leaks
grep -r "make(" internal/cluster/
grep -r "append" internal/cluster/
```

**Check:**
- ✅ Proper slice/map initialization
- ✅ No unbounded data structures
- ✅ Connection cleanup on node removal

## 📊 **Performance Benchmarks**

### Before/After Comparison
```bash
# Run existing benchmarks
go test -bench=. ./tests/unit/cache/...
go test -bench=. ./tests/unit/network/...

# Compare throughput
# - Single node performance should be similar
# - Multi-node should show better distribution
```

### Load Testing
```bash
# Use redis-benchmark for load testing
redis-benchmark -h localhost -p 8080 -n 10000 -c 50

# Expected:
# - Requests should distribute across nodes
# - MOVED responses should be minimal after warmup
# - Overall throughput should scale with nodes
```

## 🚨 **Critical Issues to Watch For**

### 1. Split-Brain Prevention
```bash
# Check cluster state consistency
curl http://localhost:9080/cluster/nodes
curl http://localhost:9081/cluster/nodes
curl http://localhost:9082/cluster/nodes

# All nodes should report same cluster topology
```

### 2. Data Consistency
```bash
# Test replication
redis-cli -h localhost -p 8080 SET replicated_key "test_value"

# Check on other nodes (if replication enabled)
redis-cli -h localhost -p 8081 GET replicated_key
```

### 3. Failover Behavior
```bash
# Simulate node failure
docker-compose -f docker-compose.scalable.yml stop hypercache-worker

# Check cluster recovery
curl http://localhost:9080/cluster/status

# Test key access still works
redis-cli -h localhost -p 8080 GET existing_key
```
